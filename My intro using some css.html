Hey! I'm <strong>Monir</strong>. Coding has changed my world of thinking. It's not just about apps. Learning to code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i> and a way to communicate wiht others on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. And I have leaned it all at <strong>SoloLearn</strong> where they build your self-esteem and keep you motivated. Please join me in this rewarding journey. You'll have fun, get help, and learn along the way!
